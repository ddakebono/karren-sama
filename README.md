karren-sama
===========

Repo for the Karren-sama IRC bot as seen on the crazypants irc

Uses PircBotX for the core IRC functions.

Requires the MySQL JDBC driver jar and the PircBotX jar to compile.

Generates bot.prop after first start which is used to configure the bot for 
your IRC network.

Some functions are specific to the CRaZyPANTS server and will need 
modification to work on other servers.

Please note that some of the commands in here have been made just for fun and have no purpose at all.
The bot is just a small project for fun so somethings may or may not work as expected.
