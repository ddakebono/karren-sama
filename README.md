karren-sama
===========

Repo for the Karren-sama IRC bot as seen on the crazypants irc

Uses PircBotX for the core IRC functions.

Requirements for compilation(Will probably be turned into a maven script when I feel like it):
<br/>
&nbsp;PircBotX.jar (Updates of the library tend to break things, watch out)
<br/>
&nbsp;Apache Common Lang
<br/>
&nbsp;Apache Common codec
<br/>
&nbsp;Google guava
<br/>
&nbsp;slf4j api and simple
<br/>
&nbsp;MySQL java connector library
<br/>
&nbsp;Apache HTTP Client
<br/>
&nbsp;Apache HTTP Core
<br/>
&nbsp;Apache Tika
	

Generates bot.prop after first start which is used to configure the bot for your IRC network.

The current source on here is up to date with the new changes on PircBotX.

Some functions are specific to the CRaZyPANTS server and will need modification to work on other servers.

Please note that some of the commands in here have been made just for fun and have no purpose at all.
<br/>
The bot is just a small project for fun so somethings may or may not work as expected.
