karren-sama
===========

Repo for the Karren-sama IRC bot as seen on the crazypants irc

Uses PircBotX for the core IRC functions.

Requirements for compilation:
	PircBotX.jar (Updates of the library tend to break things, watch out)
	Apache Common Lang
	Apache Common codec
	Google guava
	slf4j api and simple
	MySQL java connector library
	

Generates bot.prop after first start which is used to configure the bot for 
your IRC network.

The current source on here is up to date with the new changes on PircBotX, some functions are a little broken from the update however.

Some functions are specific to the CRaZyPANTS server and will need 
modification to work on other servers.

Please note that some of the commands in here have been made just for fun and have no purpose at all.
The bot is just a small project for fun so somethings may or may not work as expected.
